libgdiplus: An Open Source implementation of the GDI+ API.

This is part of the Mono project

Requirements:

	This requires the libraries used by the Cairo vector graphics library
	to build (freetype2, fontconfig, Xft2 and libpng, basically).
	See cairo/REAME. Note that libpixman is included in this package already.

To build:

	./configure --prefix=YOUPREFIX
	make

To install:

	make install

Optional build options [UNSUPPORTED]

	--with-cairo=system

	This build libgdiplus using the system's libcairo (and not the 
	internal copy of Cairo that libgdiplus bundles). Minimum Cairo 
	version is 1.4.

	--with-pango

	This build libgdiplus using Pango to render (measure and draw) 
	all of it's text. This can only be enabled if --with-cairo=system
	and requires Pango version 1.10 (or later).
