2004--04-27  Ravindra <rkumar@novell.com>

	* lineargradientbrush.[ch]: First implementation of
	lineargradientbrush.
	* Makefile.am: Added lineargradientbrush sources to the list.

2004-04-27  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* gdip.h: Added EncoderParameterValueType enum

	* image.c (GdipDrawImageRectRect, GdipDrawImagePoints): implemented.
	(gdip_encoder_parameter_search_int): start of some encoder
	parameter stuff

2004-04-26  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* general.c (gdip_open_curve_tangents):
	(gdip_closed_curve_tangents):
	Simplified. Use only one coefficient, instead of a set of
	coefficients per each point on the curve. We now take care of
	tension when calculating tangents.
	(gdip_calculate_coefficients): Removed. Microsoft doesn't use such
	a nice way of calculating coefficients. Their implementation is a
	lot more simplistic.

	Thanks to Professor Rasala for figuring this out.

	* graphics.c (GdipDrawClosedCurve2, GdipDrawCurve3) 
	(GdipFillClosedCurve2): Add tension paramater.

	* graphics-path.c (GdipAddPathCurve3): Implemented.
	(GdipAddPathCurve, GdipAddPathCurve2): Pass the work onto
	GdipAddPathCurve3.

	* gdip.h (gdip_closed_curve_tangents, gdip_open_curve_tangents):
	Updated function signature to include tension.

2004-04-26 Sanjay Gupta <gsanjay@novell.com>
	* image.c: Implemented function GdipGetImageRawFormat.
	* gdip.h: Modifieid GdipImage structure and added ImageFormat 
	enum from gdipImage.h
	* gdipImage.h: Removed ImageFormat enum to gdip.h

2004-04-25  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* graphics.c (GdipCreateFromXDrawable_linux): added method, so that
	we can interface with Gtk (i.e. to draw to a DrawingArea)

2004-04-24  Ravindra <rkumar@novell.com>

	* graphics.c: Fixed GdipGraphicsClear() function.
	* gdip.h: Removed some unwanted lines.

2004-04-23  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* bitmap.c (GdipCloneBitmapAreaI): wrong sense of assert test,
	oops

	* image.c (GdipDrawImagePoints): implemented.

2004-04-23 Peter Bartok <pbartok@novell.com>
   * graphics.c: Fixed bug #57551. Hotkey prefix now properly placed
   no matter on what line it is or how the text is aligned.

2004-04-23 Peter Bartok <pbartok@novell.com>
   * graphics.c: Implemented GdipCreateFromHWND()

2004-04-22  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* bitmap.c (GdipCloneBitmapAreaI): implemented with format
	conversion

	* image.c (GdipDrawImageRect): use gdip_bitmap_ensure_surface
	to create a surface if it's missing.  Fixes 57323

	* bitmap.c (gdip_bitmap_ensure_surface): added as a way to access
	a bitmap image's surface, creating it if it's missing

2004-04-21 Peter Bartok <pbartok@novell.com>
   * font.c: Added private GdipCreateFontFromHfont function to support
   the System.Drawing.Font.FromHfont method.
   * gdip_win32.c: Added import of Wine GetTextMetrics and GetTextName 
   functions
   * gdip_win32.h: Added some prototypes and LOGFONTA and TEXTMETRICA 
   structures

2004-04-19 Sanjay Gupta <gsanjay@novell.com>
	* image.c: Added function call to load bmp image from stream in 
          switch case stmt.

2004-04-20 Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

        * region.c -  more work on regions. New methods, fixes, and funtionality
        * graphics.c - Fixed font bug
        * gdip.h - new region functions

2004-04-19  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* graphics-path.c (GdipAddPathStringI): renamed GdipPathString ->
	GdipAddPathString (the real name); still NotImplemented

	* bitmap.c: Implemented new LockBits/UnlockBits that's consistent
	with MS semantics, and that can do conversions.  (Also some random
	whitespace cleanup, mainly as I touched functions.)

	* gdip.h: Some ARGB access macros, also a cleanup of the PixelFormat
	enum (there is a method to the madness).  Some missing prototypes also.

	* image.c: Got rid of unused gdip_getpixel_formatsize (it can be inferred
	from the pixel format).

	* pathgradientbrush.c: Sets the cairo rgb color to the center color of the
	gradient.  Not pretty, but better than nothing.
	
	* Makefile.am: Added -Wall -Wno-unused -Wno-format.  Lots of
	functions that should have been returning values weren't,
	functions used without prototypes, etc.  Touched files to fix
	missing return issues: bmpcodec.c, brush.h, font.c, gdip_win32.h,
	general.c, graphics.c, hatchbrush.c, imageattributes.c,

2004-04-19 Sanjay Gupta <gsanjay@novell.com>
	* bmpcodec.c: Fixed function for loading image from stream

2004-04-16 Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

        * region.c -  more work on regions. New methods, fixes, and funtionality
        * graphics.c - GdipFillRegion implemented

2004-04-16 Ravindra <rkumar@novell.com>

	* gdip.h: Included glib.h.
	* brush.h, solidbrush.h: Removed internal functions and added
	return type to vtable functions.
	* brush.c: Now we return status from internal functions also.
	* texturebrush.c, hatchbrush.c, solidbrush.c, pathgradientbrush.c: 
	Now we return status from internal functions also and do check for
	null pointers.

2004-04-16 Sanjay Gupta <gsanjay@novell.com>
	* bmpcodec.c: Implemented function for loading image from stream

2004-04-15 Ravindra  <rkumar@novell.com>

	* general.c (gdip_cairo_set_surface_pattern): Check for null pattern
	and return the status.
	* gdip.h (gdip_cairo_set_surface_pattern): Return status.

2004-04-15 Ravindra  <rkumar@novell.com>

	* hatchbrush.h: Moved internal functions to hatchbrush.c.
	* hatchbrush.c: Moved some internal functions around.

2004-04-15 Ravindra  <rkumar@novell.com>

	* texturebrush.h: Moved internal functions to texturebrush.c.
	* texturebrush.c: Few fixes to handle scale/rotate functions. But,
	we still don't get scaling/rotation right. Seems to be some problem
	with Cairo. Checking in code now, will see this later when I'm sure
	that Cairo is doing right.

2004-04-14 Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

        * bitmap.c -  fixes biXPelsPerMeter fields

	* bmpcodec.c -  fixes strides, fixes new WinNT BMP headers,
        support for OS/2 bitmaps, 8 and 24 bits, upside bitmaps, gets
        different pixelformats correct loading/saving, reformatted to 8
        tabs, support for load/save palette if present (RGBTRIPLE and
        SQUADS), fixes bitmap writting to allow to work with more tools
        (saving it upside down), etc.

2004-04-14  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics-path.c (GdipAddPathLine, GdipAddPathLineI): Only append
	a starting point if the current point is not the same as the point
	we're appending. This removes unnecessary subpaths, and fixes
	GdipFillPath.

2004-04-13  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* jpegcodec.c (gdip_save_jpeg_image_internal): Check for pixformat
	equal to Format24bppRgb, not 32bpp when deciding whether to do
	argb conversion.  Fixes #56967.

	* texturebrush.h: Moved WrapMode enum to gdip.h, to share
	it with the pgbrush
	
	* general.c (gdip_rect_expand_by): Helper function to
	build bounding rects

	* gdip.h: Bunch of new prototypes
	
	* pathgradientbrush.c: Stub implementations of this.  Real version
	will probably require me to add gouraud triangle shading to cairo,
	which will happen Real Soon Now.

2004-04-12  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* gdip.h, image.c: I misread the *I methods.  Implement
	them correctly, keeping the corrent int/float distinction.
	Also added a bunch of GdipDrawImage* stubs.

2004-04-11  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* general.c (GdiplusStartup): I really meant $GDIPLUS_NOX
	to mean "no X" instead of "require X".

	* texturebrush.c, image.c: Use gdip_cairo_set_surface_pattern

	* general.c: (gdip_cairo_set_surface_pattern) helper function
	to create a new pattern from a surface and set it.
	(GdiplusStartup): Don't acquire an X display if GDIPLUS_NOX is set
	(gdip_get_display_dpi): use GDIP_display instead of creating a new
	XDisplay

2004-04-10  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* gdip.h, graphics.c: Added lots of Get/Set stuffs.

2004-04-12  Ravindra  <rkumar@novell.com>

	* texturebrush.h: Internal functions should not appear here. 
	Removed internal functions. Uncommented few implemented functions.
	* texturebrush.c: Moved around few functions as per the change
	in header file.

2004-04-11  Peter Bartok <pbartok@novell.com>
   * gdip_win32.c: Added fontsize translation when creating HFONT
   * font.c: Added private function to retrieve the HFONT handle

2004-04-10  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* image.c (GdipDrawImageRectI): put back version that handles
	scaling correctly and doesn't create an extra graphics context
	unnecessarily.

	* graphics.c (gdip_graphics_attach_bitmap): set the surface on a
	GpBitmap after setting it as the cairo target; each GpBitmap
	should always have an associated cairo surface. (fixes #56803)

	* image.c (gdip_image_init): can't call get_display_dpi(), because
	we might not have an X display at all.

2004-04-10 Peter Bartok <pbartok@novell.com>
   * bitmap.c: Removed the hack that set the Win32 bitmap to white.
     Instead it now simulates alpha blending and merges the Win32
     bitmap onto the cairo image surface. This makes drawing between
     cairo and Wine/Win32 fully compatible, albeit with two 
     drawbacks: First, the copying of the bitmap is done pixel by
     pixel, and second, the color value of UNALTERED_PIXEL in
     a Win32 bitmap will be treated as transparent.

   * image.c: Removed the 'improved' GdipDrawImageRectI function. I lost a
     whole day tracking down why SWF stopped working. The 'improved'
     version doesn't seem to work (yet). Left the broken version
     with an #if 0 for future fixing.

   * gdip_win32.c: Added functions to create/delete HFONT handles tracking
     the cairo fonts.

   * gdip_win32.h: Added prototypes

   * font.c: Now also creates/deletes Wine font tracking the cairo font

   * gdip.h: Added HFONT element to GpFont structure

2004-04-10  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics.c (GdipDrawCurve):
	(GdipDrawClosedCurve, GdipFillClosedCurve): Added all the
	overloads, properly delegate the work to avoid code
	duplication. Handle the case when tension = 0; in that case, we
	draw/fill a polygon for closed curves, and just draw straight
	lines for open curves.
	(GdipDrawCurve3): Fixed signature, there was a missing offset
	argument.

	* gdip.h: Added open and closed curve drawing and filling
	functions.

2004-04-10  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>	

	* general.c (gdip_open_curve_tangents): Fixed some more errors in
	the porting of the algorithm. We should be passing Z to
	gdip_calculate_coefficients instead of count. Z = 2 * count - 1.

2004-04-10  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>	

	* graphics.c (GdipDrawCurve): Doh! Use the ask for tangents for
	open curves, not closed curves.

	* graphics-path.c (GdipResetPath): Don't set them to NULL. That
	wouldn't work, doofus.

	* graphics.c (GdipDrawCurve2I): Fixed function signature and use
	convert_points to  pass the work onto GdipDrawCurve2.
	(GdipDrawCurve3I): Fixed function signature.

	* general.c (gdip_open_curve_tangents): Fix typo.

2004-04-09 Peter Bartok <pbartok@novell.com>
   * Makefile.am: Added region.c to list of sourcefiles

2004-04-09 Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>
	* region.c - fixes to regions 

2004-04-09  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics-path.c (append_curve): Moved it to the top along with
	the other append helper functions.
	(GdipAddPathCurve, GdipAddPathCurveI): Implemented using
	gdip_open_curve_tangents.
	(GdipAddString): Fixed signature.

	* general.c (gdip_open_curve_tangents): Implemented.o
	(gdip_closed_curve_tangents): Fixed memory leak here.

	* gdip.h (gdip_open_curve_tangents): Add here. To be shared
	between graphics.c and graphics-path.c.

2004-04-08 Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>
	* region.c - Started regions implementation
        * gdip.h - signature changes

2004-04-07  Ravindra  <rkumar@novell.com>

	* texturebrush.[ch]: Added the missing functionality of clipping
	a rectangle out of image provided.

2004-04-06  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* jpegcodec.c (gdip_save_jpeg_image_internal): 
	remove stray JCS_GRAYSCALE setting, which was generating
	very bizzare images.
	
	* jpegcodec.c, pngcodec.c: Allow reading/writing non-RGBA data.
	The GpBitmap.data struct holds cairo-compatible data (always 32bpp
	RGBA), whereas the GpImage.pixFormat field holds what this data is
	actually supposed to be (i.e. grayscale).  Still no support for
	colormapped images.

2004-04-07  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics.c (make_pie): Retort to make_ellipse *after* drawing
	the line.

2004-04-06  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* jpegcodec.c (gdip_save_jpeg_image_internal): implement
	jpeg saving, both files and streams.  Format options are
	ignored for now.

	* image.c (GdipSaveImageToFile,
	(GdipSaveImageToDelegate_linux): add JPEG

	* image.c (gdip_get_pixel_format_components): added function

	* jpegcodec.c (gdip_load_jpeg_image_internal): add missing
	jpeg_destroy_decompress()

2004-04-06  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics.c (make_arc): Just follow what I did with GraphicsPath
	and use a boolean flag instead of doing FP comparison. It's not
	worth it.

2004-04-06  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* gdip.h: Added stream handling delegate prototypes,
	and some missing function protos

	* gdipImage.h: stream delegate loading/saving functions

	* image.c: stream loading/saving bits, implemented
	via linux-specific delegates.  Added guids for various
	file formats, and a gdip_image_format_for_clsid()
	helper function

	* jpegcodec.c: supports reading from a stream

	* pngcodec.c: supports writing; also supports
	reading/writing with a stream

	* image.c: blit surface directly for painting images,
	instead of creating a graphics context for it first

	* gifcodec.c, jpegcodec.c, pngcodec.c, tifcodec.c:
	Write data with the correct flags and resolution bits,
	to (almost) match what win32 outputs

2004-04-04  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* gifcodec.c, tiffcodec.c, pngcodec.c: include config.h, which
	actually enables this code.. so that the glaring bugs as a result
	of it never having been compiled before can be fixed. *cough*

	* image.c (GdipDrawImageRectI): do correct scaling
	if source and dest width/height don't match.
	(GdipLoadImageFromFile): fseek back to the start
	before passing to the loader.

2004-04-04  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* image.c: Changed loader calls to use correct
	load prototypes

	* pngcodec.c, gifcodec.c: Implemented png and gif loading

	* gdip.h: Changed ColorPalette to match GDI+; Entries is part
	of the allocated struct, not a separate pointer.  Also
	added some ARGB convenience macros.

	* bmpcodec.c, bmpcodec.h: Updated load prototypes to match
	usage

2004-04-04  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* src/image.c, src/gdip.h: Added GdipDrawImage/DrawImageRect

	* src/jpegcodec.c, src/tiffcodec.c: Implemented loading jpeg and
	tiff images.  Need to test these out on windows, to see exactly
	what formats stuff gets retruned in, but I think we should be ok
	for the most common cases.  No file saving yet.
	
	* src/bmpcodec.c, src/gifcodec.c, src/pngcodec.c:
	Remove calls to bogus (and undefined) gdip_image_new()

2004-04-04  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics.c (make_curve): Renamed from
	gdip_make_closed_curve. Added a new _CurveType argument.
	(convert_points): Moved to general.c, as it's used in
	graphics-path.c as well.

	* graphics-path.c (append_curve): Add a _CurveType
	argument. Renamed from gdip_append_closed_curve for consistency.
	(GdipAddPathClosedCurve2I): Hook it up.

	* general.c (convert_points): Moved here from graphics.c
	(gdip_open_curve_tangents): Declare here. No code yet, need to
	investigate end tangents.

	* gdip.h (_CurveType): New (private) enum for distinguishing open
	and close curves.

2004-04-04  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>	

	* graphics-path.c (append_arc): Added a new boolean argument. to
	determine if we're continuing an existing curve.

2004-04-04  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>	

	* graphics.c (make_arc): Only call move_to when we're not already at
	that point. This fixes FillPie, as cairo_fill implicitly closes
	all subpaths before filling. The extraneous move_to call earlier
	was causing Cairo to close early.
	(make_pie): Removed the debug messages.	

2004-04-02  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics.c (make_pie, GdipDrawArc): If the delta is greater than
	or equal to 360 degrees, then we're effectively drawing an
	ellipse, so make it do so.

2004-04-02  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics.c (GdipFillPieI, GdipDrawPieI): Instead of having
	another copy of the code, just use the float equivalent.
	(GdipDrawPie): Add restore/save pair.
	(make_pie): This is broken right now. Added some debugging
	messages.

2004-04-01  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics.c (GdipFillClosedCurve, GdipFillClosedCurveI):
	Implemented.

2004-04-02  Ravindra <rkumar@novell.com>
	* texturebrush.c: Implemented TileFlipXY wrapmode.

2004-04-01  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics.c (convert_points): New helper function to turn a list
	of GpPoints into GpPointFs.
	(GdipDrawClosedCurveI): Implemented using convert_points, then
	just call GdipDrawClosedCurve.

2004-04-01  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>	

	Implemented drawing ClosedCurves in Graphics and GraphicsPath. 

	These functions are implemented with the help of Prof. Rasala at
	Northeastern University. The algorithm is described in:

	     Richard Rasala, Explicit Cubic Spline Interpolation Formulas,
	     in Andrew S. Glassner, Graphics Gems, Academic Press, 1990,
	     579-584.

	Remaining TODO: Finish open curves and consider tension.
	
	* graphics.c (gdip_make_closed_curve): Translates vertices
	and tangents for cairo_curve_to.
	(GdipDrawClosedCurve): Implemented.

	* graphics-path.c (gdip_append_closed_curve): Translates vertices
	and tangents into append_bezier.
	(GdipAddPathClosedCurve2): Implemented.

2004-04-01  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>	

	* gdip.h: Added the new functions for calculating tangents.
	(CURVE_MIN_TERMS, CURVE_MAX_TERMS): Constants used in tangent
	calculations.

	* general.c (gdip_calculate_coefficients) 
	(gdip_closed_curve_tangents): Two helper functions for drawing
	closed curves.

2004-03-30  Sanjay Gupta <gsanjay@novell.com>
	*pngcodec.c Implemented one more method.
	*gdip.h Modified ColorPalette structure.

2004-03-31  Sachin Kumar <skumar1@novell.com>
	* Makefile.am: Updated file to make it work for
	  'make distcheck'.

2004-03-30 Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>
	* image.c - GdipGetImageBounds and fixes
        * bitmap.c - keep the witdh, height and pixel format in sync with the image struct

2004-03-30  Sanjay Gupta <gsanjay@novell.com>
	*pngcodec.c Added crc check
	*pngcodec.h Added crc check

2004-03-28  Sanjay Gupta <gsanjay@novell.com>
	* pngcodec.c implementing png encoder
	* pngcodec.h implementing png encoder

2004-03-26  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics.c: Prepare for the Curve and CloseCurve work by
	stubbing out some functions.

	* graphics.c (gdip_plot_path): Fixed the handling of paths
	containing PathPointTypeBezier points. Previously, we were
	resetting the index to zero at the head of each loop, so we were
	never drawing Bezier curves correctly. Also, we need to draw the
	curve immediately once we've stored 3 points, instead of waiting
	till the next iteration (which may never come). This is an
	off-by-one error.

	* graphics-path.c (append_arc): Use floats instead of ints to hold
	the center points, use doubles to hold the trig points.

2004-03-26 Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>
	* image.c - dpis and parameter checking

2004-03-26  Ravindra  <rkumar@novell.com>
	* texturebrush.c: Implemented TileFlipY wrapmode and fixed
	TileFlipX wrapmode.

2004-03-26  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics-path.c: Port the changes made to graphics here.
	(append_arc): New function, modeled after make_arc for appending
	arcs (a set of Bezier points) to the Path.
	(GdipAddPathArc): Calculate the middle angle correctly and call
	append_arc.
	(GdipAddPathPie): Removed duplication, call append_arc
	appropriately.

2004-03-26  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>
	
	* graphics.c (make_arc): Use the end angle instead of the sweep
	angle.  Previously, the code was misbehaving because I used the
	sweep angle as the end angle.
	(make_pie, DrawArc): Determine the middle angle correctly in cases
	where the delta > 180. Even though this sounds simple, it took a
	long time for me to figure out.
	(make_pie): Simplifed things a bit. Instead of replicating most of
	the arc-drawing algorithm here, use of make_arc instead. This reduced
	some of the duplicates in the code.
	(DrawArcI): I'm tired on maintaining so many copies of the same
	code, so just call DrawArc now.

	With this patch, we should be drawing Arcs and Pies correctly.
	
2004-03-25  Ravindra <rkumar@novell.com>
	* texturebrush.[ch]: Fixing texture brush. Still needs
	some work.

2004-03-24  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>
	* imageattributes.c - created and first methods

2004-03-23  Peter Bartok <pbartok@novell.com>
   * gdip_win32.h: Added definitions for Wine X11DRV_ExtEscape function;
                   removed definition and reference to internal wine structures
   * gdip_win32.c: Added import of X11DRV_ExtEscape to allow pulling the X11 Drawable without
                   knowledge of internal structures
   * graphics.c: Now uses the X11DRV_ExtEscape function to retrieve the drawable from Wine
   * general.c: Made x11drvHandle accessible for other source files (needed for X11DRV_ExtEscape)

2004-03-23  Ravindra  <rkumar@novell.com>
	* gdip.h: Changed file format to Unix.
